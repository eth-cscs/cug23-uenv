In this paper we will describe a method for defining, building and deploying alternative programming environments alongside the CPE on HPE Cray EX Alps infrastructure at CSCS.
We provide compact, testable, optimized software environments based on a descriptive recipe that can be updated independently of the CPE release cycle.
The environments are defined with a descriptive YAML recipe, and a configuration tool builds the software stack using Spack, generating a squashfs image.
Cray-MPICH is provided in a custom Spack package, so that it can be provided without a CPE installation.
A setuid utility and SLURM plugin that facilitate loading environments per user and per job are described, with benchmark results that demonstrate application and mirco-benchmark performance that matches CPE.
