Present benchmarks that demonstrate the following aspects of PE performance.

\subsection{Deployment productivity}
Benchmark the time to build and deploy a new stack in 30 minutes, and how build caches can reduce that to 5 minutes;

\subsection{Developer productivity}
squashfs deployment reduces configuration and compilation times compared to serving the same stack on a shared filesystem;

\subsection{Overheads}
Quantify the memory overheads and affect on job startup time of mounting squashfs images on compute nodes at the start of SLURM jobs;

\subsection{Benchmarks and Applications}
Microbenchmarks and application benchmarks that demonstrate equivalent performance to applications compiled with CPE on the same system.

\section{Future work}

We will discuss collaboration with HPE to provide Cray-MPICH and other HPE software packages via spack stacks, and how we plan to deliver software for the large Grace-Hopper scale out in the second half of 2023 at CSCS.
