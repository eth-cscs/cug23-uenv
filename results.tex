This section presents benchmarks and tests that demonstrate 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Deployment productivity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\assign{Ben}

Benchmark the time to build and deploy a stack from scratch vs. with a build cache.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Developer productivity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\assign{Ben}

Squashfs deployment reduces configuration and compilation times compared to serving the same stack on a shared filesystem;

Benchmark configuration time and build time with the same stack stored in different locations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item mounted with squashfs-run
    \item in memory, i.e. \lstinline|/dev/shm|
    \item on scratch.
\end{itemize}

For the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item simple hello world
    \item medium complexity application (Arbor)
    \item complex application, e.g. DLA-F
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Overheads}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\assign{Ben}

Quantify the memory overheads and affect on job startup time of mounting squashfs images on compute nodes at the start of SLURM jobs;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Benchmarks and Applications}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\assign{JG (SPH-EXA), Antonk}

Microbenchmarks and application benchmarks that demonstrate equivalent performance to applications compiled with CPE on the same system.

\todo{pick a couple of applications/micro-benchmarks to evaluate.}

benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item OSU benchmarks \assign{Ben Theo}
    \item SPH-EXA \assign{JG}
    \item \dots other?
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tools}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\assign{JG}

\begin{itemize}
    \item demonstrate DDT
    \item demonstrate a profiler?
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We will discuss collaboration with HPE to provide Cray-MPICH and other HPE software packages via spack stacks, and how we plan to deliver software for the large Grace-Hopper scale out in the second half of 2023 at CSCS.
