# CUD23 uenv Paper

In order to avoid git hell:

* write one sentence per line (so that changes made to one sentence don't conflict with changes made to other sentences)
* write separare sections in separate files - changes to one section don't need merging with changes to another section.
* think long and hard before uploading jpeg and png files to the repo.
